        <p>
          We acknowledge that unforeseen circumstances or urgent commitments may occasionally arise. However, neglecting to notify us and reschedule or cancel your appointment deprives other clients of the opportunity to secure their own appointments, as the slot appears reserved.
          Appointments canceled with less than a 12-hour notice will incur a 100% charge of the reserved appointment fee, and no refund will be processed.
          Failure to attend the appointment will result in the full appointment fee being charged and no refund or rescheduling will be processed.
          <br />
          <br />
          No-shows will be charged in full to the card held on file.
        </p>
        <h2>Late Arrivals</h2>
        <p>
          We understand that delays may occur. However, to ensure that subsequent appointments run smoothly and services remain on schedule, we ask that clients arrive on time. If you arrive more than ten minutes past your scheduled appointment time, we may not be able to accommodate you, and your appointment will be marked as completed without a refund.
        </p>
        <h2>Nurse Deployment Fee</h2>
        <p>
          In the event that an infusion is aborted, the client will be charged 50% of the booking amount. This fee applies under the following circumstances, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>Client Information Disclosure Issues: Nurse dispatched but client is unable to receive the drip because critical information was not disclosed at the time of booking (e.g., alcohol withdrawal, drug abuse).</p>
        <p>Vital Signs Out of Range: Nurse dispatched but client is unable to receive the drip due to vital signs being out of the acceptable range.</p>
        <p>Client's Condition: Nurse dispatched, but the IV is not completed due to the clientâ€™s condition (e.g., client could not tolerate the infusion, experienced a vasovagal response and did not wish to continue).</p>
        <p>Time Constraints: Nurse dispatched but IV not completed, although flowing well, due to time constraints. (Client asked the nurse to wait beyond 15 minutes)</p>
        <p>Unsafe or Unsanitary Environment: Nurse dispatched but unable to complete the IV due to an unsafe or unsanitary environment.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          This fee will NOT apply if:
        </p>
        <p>Unsuccessful IV Placement: Nurse dispatched but unable to start the IV after three attempts. Note: As per the terms of service, the nurse must be allowed to attempt placement at least three times. If the client chooses not to continue after the first attempt, 50% of the booking fee will apply.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Additionally, this fee will apply if the client facilitates a hostile or unsafe environment as perceived by the nurse during the visit. This provision does not apply if the session proceeds normally, in which case the client will only be liable for the cost of the service.</p>
        <h2>Cancellation Policy for Prepaid Packages</h2>
        <p>
          At IV Wellness Lounge Clinic we strive to provide the best service possible. However, we understand that sometimes cancellations are unavoidable. Our cancellation policy outlines the terms for refunds and cancellations initiated by clients.
