      "howItWorks": "The word ‘meso’ indicates ‘middle.’ In Mesotherapy procedures, thin needles are used to administer injections to the middle layer of skin. A therapist injects hormones, vitamins, and enzymes into your skin using very thin needles to tighten and revitalize it. The aim of this treatment is to address the root causes of skin deterioration, such as inflammation and poor circulation. Mesotherapy is commonly used to treat a variety of skin problems, including pigmentation, skin tightening, wrinkles, lines, etc.",
      "whyWeLoveIt": "Mesotherapy is a non-invasive rejuvenation treatment designed to restore vitality to both skin and hair. Using either gentle microneedling or targeted microinjections, it delivers a potent blend of vitamins, antioxidants, and plant-based actives directly where they're needed most. For the skin, it deeply hydrates, brightens, and enhances texture—revealing a radiant, youthful glow. For the scalp, it stimulates circulation, strengthens hair follicles, and supports healthy, fuller-looking hair. Whether you’re looking to revive your complexion or boost hair growth, Mesotherapy offers a refined, effective solution without downtime—nourishing beauty from the inside out.",

          "answer": "When injected into a muscle temporarily relaxes the muscle by blocking nerve impulses. As the nerve impulses are blocked the muscle is temporarily unable to contract so that dynamic wrinkles are not formed. This gives the overlying facial skin a softer, smoother and more youthful appearance."

It has been used successfully in adults and children in variety medical conditions over the last 20 years. It has been used cosmetically to treat facial wrinkles for about 15 years and has become one of the most popular and frequently used cosmetic treatments."

It should not be used in: People who have previously had an allergic reaction to Botulinum toxin type A injections. People with infection at the proposed injection site. People with Myasthenia Gravis or other neuromuscular junction disorders. People with Bell's Palsy. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. It should be used cautiously in: [please let the doctor know if the following applies to you] People at risk of bleeding as there is an increased risk of bruising post procedure. These include people who have blood clotting disorders such as Haemophilia, those who are taking treatments with anticoagulant medicines such as Warfarin, Heparin, Aspirin and Anti-Inflammatory medicines. Certain herbal remedies such as Gingko Biloba, St John's Wort and Vitamin E. People with excessive weakness or wasting in the muscle to be injected, such as those patients with history of Strokes or Bell's Palsy People with Chronic breathing difficulties."

        },
        {
          "question": "How Long Do The Effects Last?",
          "answer": "It can take about 2-14 days to see the full effects after the initial treatment. The cosmetic effects can last up to six months but typically range from three to four months. Eventually most people require re treatment as the wrinkles reappear However in some treated areas (such as frown wrinkles), the wrinkles may return less severe after repeated treatments as the unconscious muscle contraction habit is broken. We offer all our patients a free two week follow up appointment to assess the effect of treatment and administer any top up treatments if necessary."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there any side effects?",
          "answer": "Most people find that the injections cause only mild local pain and tenderness. Immediately after the injection there may be mild swelling at the injection site which usually subsides within 48 hours. Slight bruising is also possible. Side effects of these treatments are extremely rare. Occasionally, the treatment may relax nearby muscle groups causing temporary drooping of the eyebrow or eyelids. This may last for a few weeks but will resolve with time. As with any medicine an allergic reaction may occur but this is however quite rare. Anti Wrinkle has been may be some short term effects such as stinging or tension type headaches at the muscles in the forehead area. Anti Wrinkle has been used for over 20 years and does not appear to cause any serious long-term effects. Once administered, Anti Wrinkle typically leaves the body within 3-4 days, although, as with any medical procedure, it is important to seek advice from a qualified professional beforehand."
        },
        {
          "question": "How Often can I have treatments?",
          "answer": "When the effect of the injection wears off the wrinkles will always return to their pre-treatment state. Treatments can be repeated at a minimum of three monthly intervals, but the effects may last longer for some individuals, especially if they have had previous treatments to the same area."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will I still have expression in my face?",
          "answer": "The number of treatments required may vary depending on individual goals and the condition of the skin. However, a series of sessions is typically recommended for optimal results. Your skincare provider will assess your needs and develop a personalized treatment plan."

      "howItWorks": "The injectable substance used for collagen stimulation can vary. It includes polylactic acid (PLLA) fillers, calcium hydroxylapatite fillers. Each of these substances works differently to stimulate collagen production in the skin.Once injected into the skin, these substances work through different mechanisms to stimulate collagen production. For instance calcium hydroxylapatite fillers provide immediate volume by attracting water molecules to plump up the skin. Over time, they can also stimulate collagen production indirectly by triggering the skin's natural healing response.Polylactic acid fillers, on the other hand, work by stimulating the production of collagen through a process called neocollagenesis. They are gradually absorbed by the body, prompting fibroblasts (cells responsible for collagen production) to produce new collagen.",
      "whyWeLoveIt": "Because of their long-lasting results and natural-looking effects. PLLA fillers, such as Sculptra, gradually stimulate collagen production over time, leading to improved skin texture and volume that can last for up to two years. Similarly, calcium hydroxylapatite fillers, like Radiesse, provide immediate volume while also stimulating the body's collagen production, resulting in long-lasting rejuvenation of facial contours. These fillers are favored for their ability to address multiple signs of aging, including wrinkles, fine lines, and volume loss, while producing natural-looking and youthful results that enhance overall facial appearance. Additionally, the gradual collagen stimulation process ensures a smooth transition and avoids the overfilled or unnatural look that can sometimes occur with other types of fillers.",

        {
          "question": "How do skin boosters work?",
          "answer": "Skin boosters work by delivering hyaluronic acid deep into the skin. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the body that attracts and retains water. It helps to hydrate the skin from within, improve skin texture, and stimulate collagen production for a more youthful appearance."

        {
          "question": "What are the benefits of skin boosters?",
          "answer": "Skin boosters provide several benefits, including deep hydration, improved skin texture, reduced appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, enhanced skin firmness, and a more radiant complexion. They can also be used on various areas of the body, such as the face, neck, décolletage, and hands."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the treatment painful?",

          "question": "Are there any side effects?",
          "answer": "Common side effects are usually mild and temporary, such as redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection site. These effects typically resolve within a few days.

The two aims of thread lifts are to achieve a lifting action of the tissues where they are anchored and create a regenerative effect by stimulating collagen in a gradual manner. This means thread lifts have both instant and long-term benefits. The immediate improvement in skin laxity can be seen as soon as the threads are placed within the tissue. Over a 12 – 18 month period, these threads will stimulate the tissue to gradually and naturally create your own collagen.",
