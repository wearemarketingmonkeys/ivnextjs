      "howItWorks": "Body fillers are substances that are injected beneath the skin to add volume, enhance contours, and improve the overall appearance of specific areas of the body. The filler material is injected beneath the skin to fill in hollow areas, creases, or depressions, resulting in a smoother and more youthful appearance. Many body fillers contain hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally occurring substance in the body that attracts and retains moisture. Body fillers with a thicker consistency can provide structural support and lift to sagging or drooping areas. They help reposition tissues, restore contours, and create a more youthful appearance.",
      "whyWeLoveIt": "Body fillers offer several advantages and benefits, making them a popular choice for individuals seeking aesthetic enhancements. Body fillers provide a non-surgical alternative to invasive procedures such as surgery or implants. They allow individuals to enhance their appearance without the need for incisions, general anaesthesia, or prolonged recovery periods. This appeals to those who prefer non-invasive or minimally invasive options.",

Try not to touch the area excessively for the first 24 hours, except to apply arnica gel. Avoid salty foods and alcoholic beverages as they can contribute to swelling."

          "question": "What is the downtime? Can I go back to work?",
          "answer": "We use a topical anesthetic before making injections to help minimize any discomfort during the treatment. We also use an ice pack before and after. You can also take Tylenol before and after to help reduce any pain. You may experience bruising and swelling, which can take 1-2 weeks to go away. Therefore, we don't recommend scheduling your appointment right before a big event."
