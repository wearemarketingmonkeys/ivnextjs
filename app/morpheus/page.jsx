  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of radiofrequency energy?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is it the same as regular microneedling?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the downtime?",
    answer:
      "Post-treatment, you may experience redness, flaking, and puffiness. Minor bruising is also possible and typically resolves within a few days. The redness, flaking, and puffiness should subside within a few days as well.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take?",

      "The entire Morpheus8 RF Microneedling session lasts about 90 minutes, which includes the time needed to apply the numbing cream.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is it called Morpheus8?",
    answer:
      "The treatment is named after Morpheus from The Matrix, as it uses a matrix of microneedles.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I wear makeup after treatment?",
    answer:
      "We advise against wearing makeup for 1-2 days post-treatment due to possible redness during this period.",

      "Plasma injections are an excellent complement to Morpheus8, as they can accelerate recovery time. This treatment can be performed immediately after your Morpheus8 session.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you mean by 'exfoliating active ingredients'?",
    answer:
      "These are ingredients in skincare products that cause exfoliation, either physically or chemically. Examples include acids, non-comedogenic retinols, benzoyl peroxide, and scrubs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get this a few days before an event?",
    answer:
      "It's best to avoid scheduling this treatment a few days before an event, as you might experience some redness and flaking afterward.",
